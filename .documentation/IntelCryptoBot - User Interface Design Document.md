# User Interface Design Document: Intelligent Trading Bot

## Layout Structure

*   **Primary View:** A single-page dashboard layout optimized for desktop displays.
*   **Default State:** Presents a high-level overview with key status indicators and alerts prominently displayed. Minimal clutter for quick checks.
*   **Customization:** Utilizes a modular or widget-based system allowing users to show/hide/arrange more detailed components as needed, particularly during initial setup or analysis. A sidebar or top navigation bar might provide access to different sections or views (e.g., Dashboard, Logs, Settings).

## Core Components

1.  **System Status Overview:** A clear, prominent indicator showing the overall health (e.g., "Running," "Paused," "Error") of the bot and its connections (Broker API, DeepSeek API, Data Feeds).
2.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displays essential, high-level metrics like:
    *   Total P&L (perhaps selectable timeframes like Daily, Total).
    *   Current Account Equity.
    *   Drawdown Gauge (visual indicator showing current drawdown percentage relative to the maximum allowed limit).
3.  **Alerts Panel:** A dedicated area listing recent critical alerts (e.g., Risk Limit Breaches, API Errors, System Halts). Alerts should be timestamped and concise.
4.  **Performance Charts Widget (Optional/Expandable):** Visualizations like:
    *   Equity Curve over time.
    *   P&L Chart over time.
    *   Drawdown Chart over time.
    *   *(Default: Possibly hidden or minimized, expandable by user)*
5.  **Active Positions Widget (Optional/Expandable):** A table displaying currently open trades, including:
    *   Asset Symbol
    *   Direction (Long/Short)
    *   Entry Price
    *   Position Size
    *   Current P&L
    *   Stop-Loss Level
    *   Take-Profit Level
    *   *(Default: Possibly hidden or minimized, expandable by user)*
6.  **Risk Metrics Widget (Optional/Expandable):** Displays portfolio-level risk information:
    *   Total Capital Deployed / Exposure Percentage.
    *   Correlation overview (if applicable/calculated).
    *   *(Default: Possibly hidden or minimized, expandable by user)*
7.  **Log Viewer (Optional/Separate View):** Access to detailed logs:
    *   Trade Execution Log (fills, orders, cancellations).
    *   System Event Log.
    *   Error Log.
    *   Option to filter logs by type or time.
    *   *(Default: Accessible via navigation, not shown on the main dashboard unless explicitly added)*
8.  **Settings/Configuration Area (Separate View):** Secure area for:
    *   Managing API Keys (Broker, DeepSeek).
    *   Configuring Alert Preferences.
    *   Toggling dashboard widget visibility (setting defaults).
    *   Adjusting high-level configurable parameters (if any beyond initial setup).

## Interaction Patterns

*   **Drill-Down:** Clicking on summary KPIs or alerts might reveal more detailed information or navigate to the relevant log/widget.
*   **Widget Management:** Users can add/remove/collapse/expand optional widgets to customize their dashboard view.
*   **Filtering/Timeframes:** Performance charts and potentially logs should allow users to select different timeframes (e.g., Day, Week, Month, All-Time).
*   **Hover Effects:** Displaying tooltips with precise values or additional context when hovering over chart points or metrics.

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

*   **Theme:** Professional, clean, and data-focused. Avoid distracting elements.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Use a neutral base (e.g., dark grey/charcoal or clean white).
    *   Use standard financial colors purposefully: Green for profit/positive changes, Red for loss/negative changes/alerts.
    *   Use accent colors (e.g., blue, orange) sparingly for interactive elements, system status indicators, or highlighting.
*   **Charts:** Clean line charts for performance, potentially simple bar gauges for risk metrics. Ensure readability with clear axes and labels.
*   **Data Display:** Use tables for structured data like positions and logs. Ensure good alignment and spacing for readability.

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop Considerations

*   **Primary Focus:** Desktop web application. The layout should utilize screen real estate effectively.
*   **Future Mobile:** A future mobile app would likely focus on the minimalist "Status & Alert" view (Option 3), providing essential monitoring and critical alerts on the go, rather than replicating the full desktop dashboard complexity. Responsive design for the web app could offer a simplified view on mobile browsers as an interim step.

## Typography

*   **Font Choice:** Select a clean, legible sans-serif font family suitable for data display (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Open Sans).
*   **Hierarchy:** Use clear font sizing and weight variations (e.g., bold headings, standard text, slightly smaller secondary info) to establish visual hierarchy and guide the user's eye.

## Accessibility

*   **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text/data elements and their backgrounds, especially for status indicators (red/green). Consider colorblind-friendly palettes or alternative indicators (icons, text labels).
*   **Font Size:** Use legible font sizes, potentially allowing users some level of zoom or text size adjustment.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure components can be navigated and interacted with using a keyboard where applicable (though primary interaction is mouse-based).
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes if building a web interface to aid screen readers.
