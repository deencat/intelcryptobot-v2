# Product Requirements Document: Intelligent Crypto Trading Bot

## 1. Elevator Pitch

An intelligent, automated trading bot that leverages the DeepSeek API for real-time AI-powered market research (news, sentiment, technicals, fundamentals) and analysis. It employs reinforcement learning to continuously learn and optimize trading strategies based on risk-adjusted performance, while adhering to strict, configurable risk management principles (e.g., max 1% risk per trade) to protect capital and aim for consistent growth.

## 2. Who is this app for?

*   **Clarifying Question:** The plan details a complex system. Who is the primary target user for this trading bot? (e.g., individual sophisticated traders, prop trading firms, hedge funds?)

*(Assuming sophisticated traders/small firms based on complexity)*
This bot is designed for sophisticated individual traders or small proprietary trading firms who understand algorithmic trading concepts, are comfortable managing complex technology, and seek to leverage AI for market analysis and automate trade execution with robust risk controls.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **Data Ingestion:** Collect and process real-time market data (price, volume), news feeds, and potentially social media sentiment from various sources and APIs.
*   **AI-Powered Research (DeepSeek API Integration):**
    *   Analyze financial news articles for sentiment, key events, and asset impact.
    *   Analyze technical chart patterns and indicators, potentially validating traditional signals.
    *   Perform fundamental analysis on relevant assets (e.g., stocks) by evaluating financial statements, metrics, and industry context.
    *   Generate structured insights, predictions, and confidence scores from DeepSeek analysis.
    *   Optimize API calls for cost and performance (caching, batching, model selection).
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Strategy Engine:**
    *   Model the trading environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
    *   Define a state representation incorporating market data, technical indicators, DeepSeek analysis results, and portfolio status.
    *   Define an action space including buy, sell, hold decisions, order types, position sizing, stop-loss placement, and take-profit placement.
    *   Implement a reward function based on risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratio), penalizing excessive drawdowns and risk violations, and potentially rewarding consistency.
    *   Utilize RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, TD3) to learn an optimal trading policy.
    *   Incorporate DeepSeek analysis into the RL state and potentially use its confidence scores to weight decisions or validate actions.
    *   Support continuous learning/adaptation based on ongoing market data and trading results.
*   **Risk Management System:**
    *   Enforce a strict maximum risk per trade (e.g., 1% of account equity).
    *   Calculate position sizes dynamically based on the risk limit, entry price, stop-loss price, volatility, conviction (from RL/DeepSeek), correlation, and current drawdown state.
    *   Automatically determine and place stop-loss and take-profit orders based on predefined strategies (e.g., ATR-based, fixed ratio, technical levels).
    *   Implement trailing stop-loss mechanisms.
    *   Monitor and enforce portfolio-level risk controls (e.g., maximum total exposure, sector concentration, drawdown limits).
    *   Implement circuit breakers to halt or reduce trading during extreme volatility or drawdown periods.
*   **Trading Execution System:**
    *   Interface securely with multiple brokerage APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Binance, Alpaca).
    *   Place, modify, and cancel various order types (market, limit, stop).
    *   Manage position tracking and handle partial fills.
    *   Implement error handling and retry logic for reliable execution.
*   **Monitoring, Logging, and Reporting:**
    *   Log all system events, API calls, trading decisions, orders, and errors.
    *   Monitor system health (CPU, memory, connectivity, API status).
    *   Track trading performance metrics (P&L, win rate, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.) in real-time.
    *   Provide real-time monitoring dashboards visualizing performance and risk.
    *   Generate performance reports.
    *   Implement alerting for critical system issues, risk limit breaches, or significant trading events.
*   **Deployment & Maintenance:**
    *   Containerized deployment (Docker/Kubernetes) for scalability and reliability.
    *   Infrastructure management using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Pulumi).
    *   Support for different environments (development, staging, production).
    *   Implement automated backups and disaster recovery procedures.
    *   Establish processes for continuous improvement, model retraining, and security updates.

## 4. User Stories

*   **As a trader,** I want the bot to automatically analyze market news and sentiment using AI (DeepSeek) **so that** trading decisions are informed by real-time, data-driven insights without manual effort.
*   **As a trader,** I want the bot's strategy to continuously adapt using reinforcement learning **so that** its performance improves based on market feedback and changing conditions.
*   **As a trader,** I want the bot to strictly enforce a maximum 1% risk per trade by automatically calculating position size **so that** my capital is protected from large single-trade losses.
*   **As a trader,** I want the bot to automatically place and manage trades (including stop-loss and take-profit) on my broker account **so that** strategies are executed consistently 24/7.
*   **As a trader,** I want to view a real-time dashboard showing the bot's P&L, equity curve, open positions, and risk exposure **so that** I can effectively monitor its activity.
*   **As an administrator,** I want comprehensive logs of all trades, decisions, and system events **so that** I can perform audits, analyze behavior, and troubleshoot issues.
*   **As an administrator,** I want to receive immediate alerts for critical errors, API failures, or risk limit breaches **so that** I can intervene promptly if necessary.
*   **As a trader,** I want the risk management system to automatically reduce exposure during significant drawdowns **so that** capital is preserved during losing streaks.

## 5. User Interface

*   **Clarifying Question:** The documents emphasize monitoring dashboards (Grafana, plots). Is a UI required for configuration, manual overrides, or detailed strategy parameter tuning beyond initial setup? If so, what are its key features?

*(Assuming UI is primarily for Monitoring based on documents)*
The primary user interface will be a monitoring dashboard, likely web-based (potentially leveraging tools like Grafana or custom-built with FastAPI/Python frameworks mentioned), providing:

*   **Real-time Performance:** P&L chart, Equity Curve, Drawdown chart.
*   **Position Monitoring:** List of current open positions with entry price, size, current P&L, stop-loss/take-profit levels.
*   **Risk Metrics:** Display of current total exposure, portfolio VaR (if calculated), correlation metrics, and proximity to drawdown limits.
*   **System Health:** Status indicators for key components (Data Ingestion, RL Engine, Execution, DeepSeek API connection, Broker API connection).
*   **Logs:** Access to recent trade logs, error logs, and system event logs.
*   **Key Metrics:** Display of overall statistics like Win Rate, Sharpe Ratio, Average P/L per trade, Total Trades.
*   **Alerts:** A section displaying recent critical alerts.
